== Features ==

The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows. They are each detailed further below.

* Discovery and periodic remodeling of Docker containers.
* Optional status and performance monitoring of Docker containers.
* Service impact and root cause analysis. (Requires Zenoss Service Dynamics)

=== Discovery ===

The following components and properties will be automatically discovered when the ''DockerCollector'' modeler plugin is enabled for Linux devices running Docker.

[[File:docker_container_details.png|thumb|320px|Container Details]]

;Docker Host (Linux Device)
: Properties: Docker Version

;Docker Container
: Properties: ID, Title (Name), Image, Command, Ports, Created

This information is obtained by running the following commands on the Linux device via SSH.

* ''docker -v''
* ''sudo docker ps -a --no-trunc''

As with all SSH modeling, the ''zCommandUsername'', ''zCommandPassword'', and ''zKeyPath'' configuration properties are used to establish the SSH connection. For password authentication, zCommandUsername and zCommandPassword must be set. For public key authentication, zCommandUsername and zKeyPath must be set. The value of zCommandPassword will be used as the passphrase if the key file provided by zKeyPath requires a passphrase.

{{note}} The ''DockerCollector'' modeler plugin is not enabled by default for any device classes. Typically you would add it to the /Server/SSH/Linux device class so all Linux devices being monitoring via SSH will have any containers discovered. Alternatively you could create a /Server/SSH/Linux/Docker deviceclass under which you placed all of your Linux devices that operate as Docker hosts, and only add the ''DockerCollector'' modeler plugin for it.

<br clear=all>

=== Monitoring ===

Three types of monitoring are performed for all discovered Docker containers: Status, statistics, and size. The monitoring of each of these aspects has been separated so that you can choose which you are interested in monitoring more easily.

{{note}} The default value of ''zCommandCommandTimeout'' is 15 seconds. This may not be long enough for the monitoring commands detailed below to execute. It is recommended that this value be increased to 60 seconds if status and statistics monitoring are enabled. It is recommended that this value be increased to 600 seconds if size monitoring is enabled.

==== Docker Status Monitoring ====

When either zDockerMonitorContainerStatus or zDockerMonitorContainerSize are enabled, the status of the docker daemon will be checked once per minute (for zDockerMonitorContainerStatus) or once every ten minutes (for zDockerMonitorContainerSize) by running one of the following commands respectively.

* ''/usr/bin/env sudo docker ps -a --no-trunc''
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo docker ps -a -s --no-trunc''

An error event such as the following will be created if either of these commands results in an error instead of a list of containers.

;Docker Error Event
: summary: received unexpected output from docker ps
: severity: error (4)
: eventClassKey: docker-ps-status
: eventKey: docker-ps-status
: component: docker (unlinked)
: device: example-device-id
: docker_command: <docker command that resulted in an error>
: docker_output: <docker command output>

A clear event such as the following will be created if the above commands properly result in a list of containers.

;Docker Clear Event
: summary: received expected output from docker ps
: severity: clear (0)
: eventClassKey: docker-ps-status
: eventKey: docker-ps-status
: component: docker (unlinked)
: device: example-device-id
: docker_command: <docker command that resulted in an list of containers>
: docker_output: <docker command output>

The ZenPack installs a docker-ps-status event class mapping into hte /Status event class to handle these events by default. You can create an alternative mapping for the docker-ps-status eventClassKey with a lower sequence number if you wish th handle these events differently.

==== Container Status Monitoring ====

[[File:docker_container_events.png|thumb|320px|Container Events]]

When zDockerMonitorContainerStatus is enabled, the status of each container will be checked once per minute by running the following command.

* ''/usr/bin/env sudo docker ps -a --no-trunc''

Containers with any status other than "Up" or "Created" will result in a critical event being created for the container with the following example fields.

;Clear Down Event
: summary: container status: exited (0) 31 minutes ago
: severity: critical (5)
: eventClassKey: dockerContainerStatus
: eventKey: dockerContainerStatus
: component: docker-container-id
: device: example-device-id

Containers with an "Up" or "Created" status will result in a clear event being created for the container with the following example fields.

;Container Up Event
: summary: container status: up
: severity: clear (0)
: eventClassKey: dockerContainerStatus
: eventKey: dockerContainerStatus
: component: docker-container-id
: device: example-device-id

The ZenPack installs a dockerContainerStatus event class mapping into the /Status event class to handle these events by default. You can create an alternative mapping for the dockerContainerStatus eventClassKey with a lower sequence number if you wish to handle these events differently.

<br clear=all>

==== Container Statistics Monitoring ====

When zDockerMonitorContainerStats is enabled, the statistics of each container will be collected once every five minutes by running the following commands.

* ''/usr/bin/env sudo find /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct/ -printf "\n%p\n" -exec cat {} 2>/dev/null \;''
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo find /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/ -printf "\n%p\n" -exec cat {} 2>/dev/null \;''
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo find /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/ -printf "\n%p\n" -exec cat {} 2>/dev/null \;''

These three commands capture the cgroup CPU, memory, and IO usage respectively. They will work regardless of whether the cgroupfs or systemd driver are used.

The following datapoints are parsed from the results of these commands.

;cpuacct_usage
: Description: Total usage include user and system time.

==== Container Size Monitoring ====

When zDockerMonitorContainerSize is enabled, the real size and virtual size of each container will be monitored once every ten minutes by running the following command.

* ''/usr/bin/env sudo docker ps -a -s --no-trunc 2>/dev/null''

{{note}} zDockerMonitorContainerSize is not enabled by default. The reason for this is that adding ''-s'' flag to ''docker ps'' can result in the command taking a very long time to run when many containers, or large containers are used. It is recommended that you attempt to run the command on your Docker hosts manually and see that it takes less than 10 minutes to execute before enabled zDockerMonitorContainerSize.

{{note}} Older versions of Docker only report real size, not virtual size. The exact version cut-off isn't known, but Docker 1.6.2 as known to not report virtual size.

The following datapoints are parsed from the results of this command.

;size_size
: Description: Actual space used by this specific container.
: Provenance: First number in the SIZE column of ''docker ps -s'' converted to bytes.
: Units: bytes

;size_size_virtual
: Description: Virtual size of container including image layers that may be shared with other containers.
: Provenance: Parenthetical number in the SIZE column of ''docker ps -s'' converted to bytes
: Units: bytes

The following graph is build using these datapoints.

=== Service Impact ===

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds
built-in service impact capability for Docker Containers. The following service impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included in any services containing one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.

[[File:docker_container_dynamicview.png|thumb|320px|Dynamic View]]

;Service Impact Relationships
* Device affects related Docker Containers.

<br clear=all>

== Usage ==

To begin discovering and monitoring Docker containers you must start by deciding what kind of monitoring you want to perform. There are three configuration properties that will control how container monitoring is performed.

* zDockerMonitorContainerStatus
* zDockerMonitorContainerStats
* zDockerMonitorContainerSize

You can refer to the various container monitoring sections above to understand exactly what the implications of each of these properties are. By default only ''zDockerMonitorContainerStatus'' and ''zDockerMonitorContainerStats'' are enabled. This is due to a potential performance consideration when monitoring container sizes. See the note above in the ''Container Size Monitoring'' section.

After setting these configuration properties to the desired values, you must enable the ''DockerCollector'' modeler plugin for the device class(es) or device(s) for which you want to discover running containers. One possibility would be to create a ''/Server/SSH/Linux/Docker'' device class, and add ''DockerCollector'' to the list of modeler plugins it will inherit from the ''/Server/SSH/Linux'' device class.

=== SSH Configuration ===

Docker container discovery and monitoring will occur by running commands on the monitored device with SSH. This SSH connectivity will use the same SSH configuration that is used for normal Linux device monitoring. The following configuration properties can be used to control SSH access.

* zCommandUsername
* zCommandPassword
* zKeyPath
* zCommandCommandTimeout

See the ''Discovery'' section for more information on how ''zCommandUsername'', ''zCommandPassword'', and ''zKeyPath'' are used. See the ''Monitoring'' section for a special note on ''zCommandCommandTimeout''.

=== sudo Configuration ===

In addition to SSH access, this ZenPack executes specific commands via ''sudo'' both during discovery and monitoring. This means that ''sudo'' must be installed on the monitored system, and if ''zCommandUsername'' is not root, sudo must be configured to allow the user specified in ''zCommandUsername'' permission to run the following commands without specifying a password.

;Discovery:
* ''sudo docker ps -a --no-trunc''

;If ''zDockerMonitorContainerStatus'' is enabled:
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo docker ps -a --no-trunc''

;If ''zDockerMonitorContainerSize'' is enabled:
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo docker ps -a -s --no-trunc''

;If ''zDockerMonitorContainerStats'' is enabled:
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo find /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct/ -printf "\n%p\n" -exec cat {} 2>/dev/null \;''
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo find /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/ -printf "\n%p\n" -exec cat {} 2>/dev/null \;''
* ''/usr/bin/env sudo find /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/ -printf "\n%p\n" -exec cat {} 2>/dev/null \;''

It is also important that sudo be configured to allow running commands without a tty. Specifically this means that a line such as the following in sudoers (''visudo'') can prevent discovery and monitoring.

<source>
Defaults requiretty
</source>

You can resolve this by disabling the requiretty option for all users by changing the above line to the following:

<source>
Defaults !requiretty
</source>

You can also selectively disable requiretty just for the user configured in Zenoss' ''zCommandUsername'' configuration property. Assuming that username was ''zenmonitor'', this is how that would look.

<source>
Defaults requiretty
Defaults:zenmonitor !requiretty
<source>
